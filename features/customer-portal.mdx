## Smart notifications

Revize adds helpful notification messages to the order status page that guide customers:

- **"Your order is available to edit"** - Shows when editing is open
- **"30 minutes left"** - Live countdown timer showing remaining edit time  
- **"Free gifts can't be edited"** - Explains restrictions clearly
- **"Order can no longer be edited"** - Tells customers when the window has closed
- **"Payment required to proceed"** - Guides customers when payment is needed

These notifications appear automatically and keep customers informed throughout the process.

## When the portal appears and hides

**The portal shows when:**
- ✅ The order is within the edit window you set  
- ✅ The customer opens the order status page  
- ✅ The order hasn't been fulfilled yet  
- ✅ The order meets your editing restrictions (if any)

**The portal hides when:**
- ❌ The edit window expires  
- ❌ The order is fulfilled  
- ❌ The order is canceled  
- ❌ The order is excluded by tags or restrictions

**Always available modules:**
Even after the editing window expires, you can configure these modules to remain visible:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Edit Tax Invoice" icon="file-invoice" color="#14b8a6">
    Customers can still generate or update tax invoices even after editing closes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Contact Support" icon="headset" color="#6366f1">
    Support request option remains available for post-edit assistance.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  **Important:** Even when the main portal hides, the notification bar remains visible to inform customers about the order status, whether payment is required, or if the order has been canceled.
