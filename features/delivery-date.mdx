## How delivery date preferences work

**What customers can do:**
- Select any future date as their delivery preference
- Add the date preference during their edit window
- Change or update the preferred date if needed

**How it appears in Shopify:**
- Added to order attributes as `preferred_delivery_date`
- Shows in "Additional details" section on the order page
- Visible to your fulfillment team for coordination

<Note>
  **Important:** This is a preference note, not a guaranteed delivery date. It helps your team understand customer timing needs, but doesn't automatically change shipping or guarantee delivery on that specific date.
