## Configure order cancellation refunds

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Refund to original payment method" icon="credit-card">
    **Full refunds through Shopify's payment system**
    
    When customers cancel orders, Revize automatically issues a full refund back to their original payment method:
    
    - **Credit cards** - refund appears in 3-5 business days
    - **PayPal** - instant refund to PayPal account  
    - **Digital wallets** - Apple Pay, Google Pay refunds process automatically
    - **Buy now, pay later** - refunds through Klarna, Afterpay, etc.
    
    <Note>
      This option provides the most familiar experience for customers who expect traditional refunds.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Store credit refunds" icon="gift">
    **Convert cancellations into future purchases**
    
    Issue store credit instead of cash refunds to retain revenue and encourage repeat purchases:
    
    - **Customer loyalty** - keeps money in your ecosystem
    - **Higher lifetime value** - store credit often leads to larger future orders
    - **Reduced processing fees** - no payment processor refund fees
    - **Instant availability** - credit is available immediately for next purchase
    
    Perfect for building customer loyalty while protecting your cash flow.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="No refund policy" icon="ban">
    **Block cancellations with no refund option**
    
    If you select "No refund" in your [payments and refunds settings](/setup/payments-and-refunds):
    
    - **Cancellation option disappears** - customers won't see the cancel button
    - **Clear policy enforcement** - aligns with strict no-refund business policies
    - **Revenue protection** - prevents revenue loss from cancellations
    
    Use this for final sale items, custom products, or strict business policies.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Customizable cancellation reasons

<Tip>
  **Customize cancellation reasons:** Edit the predefined cancellation reasons under **Translations > Customer Portal > Cancellation Reasons** to match your business needs.
</Tip>

**Default cancellation reasons include:**
- "Changed my mind"
- "Found a better price elsewhere"  
- "Ordered by mistake"
- "Delivery too slow"
- "Product no longer needed"
- "Custom reason" (allows customers to type their own)

**Why collect cancellation reasons:**
- Identify common issues with your products or checkout process
- Improve your store based on customer feedback
- Track trends in cancellation patterns
- Provide better customer service insights

<Note>
  **Track cancellation analytics:** View cancellation data, cost savings, and customer reasons under **Analytics** in your Revize dashboard. For custom reasons analysis, contact support - detailed custom reason reporting will be available on the dashboard soon.
</Note>

## Control cancellation availability

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Hide cancellation by order tags" icon="tag">
    **Restrict cancellations for specific orders**
    
    Use [order edit restrictions](/setup/order-edit-restrictions) to hide the cancel option for certain orders:
    
    - **High-risk orders** - prevent cancellation of flagged orders
    - **Custom products** - block cancellation of personalized items
    - **Wholesale orders** - different policies for B2B customers
    - **Final sale items** - enforce no-cancellation policies
    
    Simply tag orders with your restriction tags and the cancel option won't appear. You'll need to contact support (hello@revize.app) to set edit restrictions specifically for cancellation.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
