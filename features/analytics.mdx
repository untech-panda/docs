**Understanding what customers edit:**

- Adding products to orders
- Email and phone corrections
- Order cancellations

The pie chart shows exactly which editing features customers use most, helping you understand customer needs and focus on improving the most popular features.

<Info>
  **Analytics insight:** If shipping address edits are high, customers are catching delivery mistakes early - saving you failed delivery costs. If product additions are popular, focus on optimizing your upsell flow for even better results.
</Info>

  <small>Three key metrics that show your real business results from order editing.</small>

**Three charts that matter most:**

**Revenue per edit**  
Average additional revenue generated per edited order. Shows customers aren't just fixing mistakes - they're adding value to their purchases.

**Support hours saved**  
Time your support team saved because customers edited orders themselves.  
*Calculation: Support Tickets Avoided × 15 minutes*

**Total savings impact**  
Complete cost savings from reduced support work and prevented cancellations.  
*Formula: (Self-Service Edits × \$10) + (Cancellations Avoided × \$15)*

## Cancellation insights

    alt="Pie chart showing customer cancellation reasons"
    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", width: "100%", boxShadow: "0 4px 14px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)" }}
  />
  <small>Understand why customers cancel to improve your store and reduce future cancellations.</small>
</Frame>

**Learn from cancellation patterns:**
- "Found a better price elsewhere"
- "Shipping time too long"
- "Ordered by mistake"
- "Changed my mind"
- Custom reasons

Use this data to identify trends and improve your customer experience, pricing strategies, and shipping options.

<Tip>
  **Actionable insight:** If "found a better price elsewhere" is common, consider dynamic pricing strategies. If "shipping time too long" appears frequently, explore express shipping options or faster fulfillment partners.
