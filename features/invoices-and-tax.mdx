## What Shopify customers can edit on tax invoices

**Shopify billing address fields:**
- Customer first name and last name
- Complete street address and apartment/suite details
- City, province/state, and postal code
- Country selection and phone number

**Business tax information for compliance:**
- Company name (optional for business customers)
- Tax registration number (VAT, GST, EIN - optional)

<Note>
  **Important for Shopify users:** Invoice edits only update the tax invoice document. Shopify doesn't allow changing the billing address in the backend after an order is created.
</Note>

## Extended invoice editing availability for Shopify stores

Enable the optional setting to keep Shopify invoice editing available even after the main edit window closes. Business customers often need tax invoices weeks after purchase for accounting and compliance.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Order Editing settings">
    In the Revize app, click **Order Editing** in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable the feature">
    Toggle on **Edit tax invoice** under Customer edit options and click **Save**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable extended availability (optional)">
    Toggle on **Allow customers to update their tax invoice after editing deadline** if needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>
