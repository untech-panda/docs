## Why Shopify product editing matters

  <Card title="Reduce Returns" icon="arrow-down" color="#ef4444">
    Customers fix size and color mistakes before items ship, preventing costly returns and exchanges.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Save Orders from Cancellation" icon="shield-check" color="#10b981">
    Instead of canceling wrong orders, customers swap to the right products and keep buying.

    Customers often upgrade to premium variants or add matching items while editing.
  </Card>

## What customers can change

Shopify customers can edit their orders in multiple ways:

- **Product variants:** Switch sizes, colors, styles, or capacity (Medium to Large, Blue to Red, 32GB to 64GB)
- **Quantities:** Increase or decrease item amounts for bulk orders or corrections
- **Product replacements:** Swap completely different products (iPhone case to Samsung case, t-shirt to hoodie)  
- **Item removal:** Delete unwanted products with automatic refunds

## Real-time inventory management

Revize automatically checks inventory levels based on the customer's shipping location and delivery zone. When customers edit products, inventory is verified against the specific warehouse or fulfillment location that would ship to their address. This zone-based inventory checking ensures customers can only select variants that are actually available for delivery to their location. If a product runs out of stock at the relevant warehouse, it's immediately marked as unavailable and cannot be added to the edited order.

<Note>
  Inventory availability is determined by shipping zones - customers only see stock from warehouses that can fulfill orders to their delivery address.
</Note>
