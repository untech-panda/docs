# Give Customers Control Over Their Orders

Revize lets your customers fix mistakes and make changes after checkout without contacting support. That means fewer returns, fewer tickets, and smoother operations.

## Why It Matters

All growing brands face the same problem: customers need to change shipping addresses, swap variants, adjust quantities, or cancel orders. These requests overwhelm support and slow fulfillment.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Customer places order">
    Order automatically goes on hold (recommended) for the edit deadline you set in the app, giving customers time to make changes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer makes edits">
    From the order status page, customers can edit addresses, change products, adjust quantities, add more products, upgrade shipping method, and more
  </Step>
  <Step title="Order processes normally">
    Once editing window closes, order releases to your fulfillment system
  </Step>
</Steps>
