# Give customers control over their orders

Revize lets your customers fix mistakes and make changes after checkout - without contacting support.

<Info>
Every successful brand deals with the same problems: customers need to change shipping addresses, swap product variants, adjust quantities, or cancel orders. These requests flood your support team and slow down operations.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Customer places order">
    Order automatically goes on hold, giving customers time to make changes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer makes edits">
    From the order status page, customers can edit addresses, change products, adjust quantities, and more
  </Step>
  <Step title="Order processes normally">
    Once editing window closes, order releases to your fulfillment system
  </Step>
</Steps>
