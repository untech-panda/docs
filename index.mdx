# Give Customers Control Over Their Orders

Revize lets your customers fix mistakes and make changes after checkout without contacting support. That means fewer returns, fewer tickets, and smoother operations.

<Info>
  Transform post-checkout frustration into customer satisfaction with self-service order editing that works seamlessly with your existing workflow.
</Info>

## Why It Matters

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Support Challenges">
    **Common Issues as Your Store Grows:**

    - Support teams get flooded with change requests
    - Simple changes take too long, leading to frustration
    - Your team spends time fixing orders manually
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Revenue Impact">
    **Lost Opportunities:**

    - Customers cancel because they can't fix a small mistake
    - You miss out on easy upsells after checkout
    - Potential returns from preventable mistakes
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Psychological Aspects">
    **Order Mistake Anxiety & Customer Psychology:**

    - 70% of product returns are due to wrong sizes, causing immediate post-purchase regret
    - Post-purchase dissonance creates negative psychological states when customers can't fix mistakes
    - 17% of customers abandon purchases due to complex checkout processes and fear of errors
    - Customers feel helpless when told "order already processed" for simple mistakes
    - 69% are less likely to purchase again after negative order fulfillment experiences
    - Social anxiety affects 6.8% of customers who avoid reordering after address mistakes
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Customer places order">
    The order is placed on hold for the time window you set, giving customers a chance to make changes before it moves to fulfillment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer makes edits">
    From the order status page, customers can edit addresses, change products, adjust quantities, add more products, upgrade shipping method, and more.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Order processes normally">
    Once editing window closes, order releases to your fulfillment system
  </Step>
</Steps>
