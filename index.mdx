## How Revize Works on Shopify

<Steps>
  <Step title="Customer places order">
    Revize puts new orders on hold during the edit window, giving customers time to make changes before fulfillment begins. If your fulfillment process needs orders to flow immediately, you can skip the hold and use release tags instead. This flexibility ensures Revize works with any fulfillment setup.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer makes edits">
    From the Shopify order status page, customers can update shipping addresses, change variants, adjust quantities, add products, or upgrade shipping. No need to contact support.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Payments and refunds">
    When order edits affect the total, Revize automatically triggers Shopify to collect additional payment or issue partial refunds. No manual work, no spreadsheets.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Order processes normally">
    Once the edit window closes, the order syncs directly into your fulfillment system. No duplicates. No delays. Just clean, accurate data.
  </Step>
</Steps>
