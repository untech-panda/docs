## Getting started with Revize order editing app

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Revize and how does this Shopify order editing app work?" icon="question">
    Revize is a powerful **Shopify order editing app** that empowers your customers to modify their orders after checkout through a seamless self-service portal. Instead of creating support tickets, customers can independently update shipping addresses, change product quantities, add new products (**post-purchase upsell**), upgrade shipping, and even cancel orders. This **order modification app** significantly reduces your support workload while increasing average order value and customer satisfaction through automated **post-purchase order editing**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How quickly can I set up this order editing solution?" icon="clock">
    Revize can be fully configured in just 5 minutes! Installation from the [Shopify App Store](https://apps.shopify.com/revize) takes about 2 minutes, and basic configuration (setting your edit window, refund options, and customer permissions) takes another 3. You can start testing immediately with Shopify draft orders to ensure your **order modification flow** works perfectly before enabling live **customer self-service order editing**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does this order editing app work with all Shopify plans and themes?" icon="shopify">
    Yes, Revize is fully compatible with all Shopify plans (from Basic to **Shopify Plus**) and works seamlessly with any Shopify theme, including headless commerce setups. Our **Shopify order management app** portal automatically inherits your store's theme and checkout styling for a completely consistent brand experience on both mobile and desktop during **post-purchase order modifications**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much does this order editing app reduce customer support workload?" icon="headphones">
    On average, merchants using Revize see a **30-50% reduction in order-related support tickets**. Common requests like "can I change my shipping address?" or "I ordered the wrong size" are handled entirely by the customer through our **self-service order editing** system. This frees up your support team to focus on complex issues that truly require a human touch.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Setup and configuration for post-purchase order editing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What order editing window options are available in this app?" icon="clock">
    Revize offers maximum flexibility for **post-purchase order editing**. You can set time-based edit windows from 5 minutes to 48 hours. Alternatively, you can keep editing open until an order is fulfilled or create scheduled cutoffs (e.g., daily at 2 PM) to align perfectly with your 3PL or warehouse schedule. This control ensures a smooth **Shopify order management** process.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I control which orders and products allow post-checkout editing?" icon="sliders">
    Absolutely! Use order tags and product tags to create simple yet powerful exclusion rules in our **order modification app**. For example, you can block editing on orders tagged with "custom-engraving" or prevent edits to products tagged with "final-sale". This gives you granular control over the **customer self-service order editing** experience.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I test this order editing app safely before launching?" icon="flask">
    We highly recommend using Shopify's [draft orders feature](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/orders/create-orders) to safely test every **post-purchase order editing** scenario. Create test orders for different products, test the **post-purchase upsell** flow, and process payments without affecting your live store data. This ensures a flawless launch of your **self-service order modifications**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does this order editing app integrate with existing fulfillment systems?" icon="truck">
    Yes, Revize integrates seamlessly with any 3PL provider or ERP system that works with Shopify's order API (including ShipStation, NetSuite, ShipBob, Flexport, etc.). Our **Shopify order management app** can automatically place orders on hold during the edit window and release them for fulfillment once the window closes, ensuring your **fulfillment workflow** is never disrupted by customer order modifications.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Customer experience with self-service order editing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do customers access the order editing portal after checkout?" icon="arrow-pointer">
    Customers can **edit their Shopify order** from multiple convenient entry points: the order status page (thank you page), or by clicking the "Edit Order" link in their order confirmation email. Our **post-purchase order editing** portal opens directly within your store's native environment, maintaining a seamless brand experience for **customer self-service order editing**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What self-service editing features do customers have access to?" icon="pen">
    Customers can perform a wide range of **order modifications** based on your settings. This includes **changing a shipping address after purchase**, updating contact info, changing product variants (e.g., size or color), adding or removing products, upgrading shipping methods, and cancelling their order. You have full control over which of these **post-purchase order editing** features are enabled.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does the complete order editing flow work from checkout to fulfillment?" icon="arrow-progress">
    When a new order is placed, Revize can place it on hold for **post-purchase order editing**. During the edit window, the customer can make changes through our **self-service order modification** system. If they add items, they complete the payment for the difference via Shopify's secure checkout. If no edits are made, the order is automatically released to your fulfillment queue when the window expires. This automated **order modification** process prevents errors.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens when the post-purchase editing window expires?" icon="clock">
    Once the **order editing** window closes, the "Edit Order" links and buttons disappear from the customer's order status page. They are shown a clear message that the editing period has ended. The order is then automatically released for fulfillment, requiring no manual intervention from your team after **customer self-service order editing** ends.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How are additional payments handled during order editing?" icon="credit-card">
    All additional payments for **post-purchase upsells** or shipping upgrades are processed securely through your existing Shopify Payments gateway. If a customer adds items but fails to complete the payment during **post-purchase order editing**, the order remains on hold and reminder emails are sent. This ensures you never ship an order that hasn't been fully paid for.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced order calculation features for post-purchase modifications

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Are discounts and promotions recalculated during order editing?" icon="percent">
    Yes! This is a key feature that sets our **Shopify order editing app** apart. Our smart engine **brilliantly recalculates all applicable discounts**—including promo codes, automatic discounts, and tiered pricing—when a customer modifies their order through **post-purchase order editing**. This maintains your promotional integrity and ensures the customer always sees the correct, final price during **order modifications**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do shipping taxes update when customers change their delivery address?" icon="location-dot">
    Absolutely. Revize automatically recalculates all applicable taxes when a **customer changes their shipping address** during **post-purchase order editing**. Our **order modification app** ensures compliance with regional tax laws by applying the correct rates for the new destination, preventing compliance headaches and ensuring accurate order totals.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does this order editing app handle shipping rate changes during modifications?" icon="truck-fast">
    Our **Shopify order management app** communicates in real-time with your store's shipping settings. When a customer adds/removes products or changes their address during **post-purchase order editing**, Revize instantly re-evaluates the available shipping methods and rates. This ensures customers always see accurate, real-time shipping options that reflect their modified cart and new destination during **self-service order modifications**.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Business operations and order management analytics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does this order editing app handle refunds and payments?" icon="money-bill-wave">
    All payment and refund transactions in our **Shopify order editing app** occur through Shopify's secure system. For additions during **post-purchase order editing**, customers pay the difference. For removals or cancellations, refunds can be processed automatically to the original payment method or issued as store credit, giving you full control over your **returns and refunds policy** within our **order modification app**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does this order editing app protect inventory during modifications?" icon="box">
    Revize syncs directly with Shopify's native inventory system during **post-purchase order editing**. It checks stock levels in real-time when customers add products to prevent overselling and automatically restocks inventory when items are removed through **customer self-service order editing**. This ensures your **Shopify inventory management** remains accurate at all times during **order modifications**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What analytics does this order management app provide?" icon="chart-line">
    Our **Shopify order editing app** analytics dashboard gives you a clear view of your ROI from **post-purchase order editing**. Track total orders edited, revenue generated from **post-purchase upsells**, support hours saved through **self-service order modifications**, and see which edits are most common. All data links directly to the corresponding Shopify orders for easy verification.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I track and organize post-purchase edited orders?" icon="tags">
    Revize automatically applies descriptive tags (e.g., `revize-edited`, `revize-upsell`) to orders in your Shopify Admin after **customer self-service order editing**. This makes it incredibly easy to filter, track, and build custom workflows for edited orders within your existing **Shopify order management** process, helping you analyze the impact of **post-purchase order modifications**.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Customers can't see order editing links or portal" icon="link-slash">
    **Common solutions:** First, check that the Revize app block is enabled on your order status page in the theme customizer for **post-purchase order editing**. Second, ensure the specific order doesn't have a blocking tag and that the edit window hasn't expired. If you've checked these **customer self-service order editing** requirements, contact hello@revize.app for a quick resolution.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Order editing portal won't load or display correctly" icon="exclamation">
    **Quick fixes:** This is often a browser-specific issue affecting **post-purchase order editing**. Ask the customer to clear their browser cache, disable any ad-blocking extensions, or try a different browser. Most loading issues with our **order modification app** are resolved by these simple steps.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Payment processing errors during order editing" icon="credit-card">
    **Payment issues:** Since all payments in our **Shopify order editing app** are handled by Shopify, these errors are typically related to the customer's payment method (e.g., insufficient funds, incorrect CVC). Advise the customer to try a different card or contact their bank for **post-purchase order editing** payment issues.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Orders not held properly during post-purchase editing windows" icon="pause">
    **Fulfillment sync:** Check your store's order processing settings to ensure you don't have an automation that's fulfilling orders instantly, bypassing the **post-purchase order editing** window. If you use a 3PL, ensure they are configured to respect Shopify's fulfillment hold status during **customer self-service order editing**. Our team can help you troubleshoot this.
