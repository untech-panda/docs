## 2. Set the edit deadline

<Note>
  By default, Revize places new orders on hold. This gives customers time to make edits before fulfillment starts. You can turn the hold off if your workflow needs immediate processing.

    In the Revize app, select <strong>Order Editing</strong> in the left sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pick a duration or a scheduled cutoff">
    Choose a preset like 15, 30, or 60 minutes, set a custom duration, or pick a scheduled cutoff time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose processing">
    Select <strong>Hold orders</strong> for the edit window, or <strong>Skip hold</strong> if your 3PL only pulls finalized orders. Optionally add a release tag for ready orders.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click <strong>Save</strong>.
  </Step>
</Steps>
