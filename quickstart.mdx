# Quick Setup Guide

Get order editing live on your store in under 5 minutes with these 5 essential configurations.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Order Editing Deadline">
    **Choose how long customers can edit their orders**
    
    - **30 minutes** (recommended for most stores)
    - **Until fulfillment** (flexible but requires manual oversight)
    - **Custom timeframe** (2 hours, 24 hours, etc.)
    - **Scheduled cutoff** (daily cutoff times - e.g., all orders editable until 1:00 AM)
    
    <Tip>
    Start with 30 minutes - it gives customers time to catch mistakes without delaying fulfillment.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Order Hold Settings">
    **Choose how orders are processed during editing**
    
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Hold Orders (Recommended)" icon="pause">
        Orders automatically pause for editing, then release to fulfillment. Works seamlessly with all 3PLs.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Skip Order Hold" icon="tag">
        Orders process immediately. Revize adds tags when editing ends for 3PL pickup. *Requires deeper integration.*
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    
    <Warning>
    Order hold is recommended - it prevents fulfillment conflicts and works with any system.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Refund Methods">
    **Control how refunds work when customers reduce order value**
