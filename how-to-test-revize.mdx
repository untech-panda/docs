## 2. Make edits on the order status page

<Steps>

    Add an item from the Revize Customer Portal. You will see a <strong>Pay now</strong> card with the extra amount and an updated order summary. Click <strong>Pay now</strong> to charge and apply the change.

  <Step title="Remove value or downgrade">
    Remove an item, lower quantity, or switch to a cheaper variant. Revize shows a <strong>Refund</strong> button with the amount and an updated summary. Click <strong>Refund</strong> to apply it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make a change with no price difference">

## 3. Scenarios to try

- **Update the shipping address.** Change the address and save. The order summary refreshes in the portal.  
- **Swap a variant (same price).** Change size or color. You will see **Confirm** and **Undo**. Click **Confirm** to apply.  
- **Add a product.** The portal shows a **Pay now** card with the additional amount and an updated summary. Click **Pay now** to charge and apply.  
- **Upgrade the shipping method.** Pick a faster option. If it costs more, you will see **Pay now** with the difference.  
- **Cancel the order.** Choose **Cancel order**. Revize follows your refund setting, either original payment or store credit, and shows the amount before you confirm.  
- **Generate a tax invoice.** Open **Edit tax invoice**, add or update billing details or a tax ID, then download the updated invoice.  
- **Contact support.** Use **Support** in the portal to send a request. This is useful when an edit needs human help.

<Note>
  Done. If you do not see the Revize Customer Portal and Notifications on the order status page, add the Revize blocks in the Shopify checkout editor, then test again.
