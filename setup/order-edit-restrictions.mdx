description: "Block editing for specific orders or products using order tags and product tags. Control what customers can edit with simple tag-based rules."

<Note>
  Use order tags and product tags to block edits. Leave fields blank to allow edits on everything. Need advanced controls? Email [hello@revize.app](mailto:hello@revize.app) and we'll configure them for you.
</Note>

## Set it in the app

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Settings">
    In the Revize app, click **Settings** in the sidebar, then scroll to **Order edit restrictions**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add blocking tags">
    Enter tags you want to block under **Order tags** and **Product tags**, then click **Save**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tag in Shopify">
    Add these same tags to your orders or products in Shopify. Revize reads them automatically and blocks edits.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How it works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Block entire orders with order tags" icon="tag">
    **What it does**
    
    Add a tag to an order in Shopify. If that tag is in your block list, customers cannot edit anything on that order.

    **How to set it up**
    1. Add `no-edit` to your order tag block list in Revize
    2. Tag an order with `no-edit` in Shopify
    3. That entire order becomes uneditable

    **Common examples**
    - Block `high-risk` orders from being edited
    - Keep `wholesale` orders locked
    - Prevent edits on `final-sale` orders
    - Block `rush` orders that are already being packed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Block specific products with product tags" icon="box">
    **What it does**
    
    Add a tag to a product in Shopify. If that tag is in your block list, customers cannot edit that specific item in their order. Other items remain editable.

    **What gets blocked for that product**
    - Changing quantity
    - Switching size, color, or variant
    - Removing it from the order

    **How to set it up**
    1. Add `final-sale` to your product tag block list in Revize
    2. Tag a product with `final-sale` in Shopify
    3. That product becomes uneditable in all orders

    **Common examples**
    - Block `final-sale` items from being changed
    - Protect `custom` or `personalized` products
    - Lock `bundle` components from being modified
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Where to find tags in Shopify

**For orders:**
1. Go to Orders in your Shopify admin
2. Click on any order
3. Scroll down to see the Tags field
4. Add tags like `no-edit` or `high-risk`

**For products:**
1. Go to Products in your Shopify admin
2. Click on any product
3. In the Search engine listing section, find Tags
4. Add tags like `final-sale` or `custom`

## Advanced restrictions

For more complex rules, we can configure these for you:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Block cancellations only" icon="ban" color="#ef4444">
    Allow edits but prevent order cancellations using specific order tags.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hide address changes" icon="shield" color="#0ea5e9">
    Block address edits for specific customer types using customer tags.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Curated add-products" icon="list" color="#22c55e">
    Show only specific products when customers try to add items to their order.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Custom property blocks" icon="code" color="#8b5cf6">
    Block edits based on custom line item properties like bundle IDs or special flags.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Best practices

**Use clear tag names:**
- `no-edit` instead of `ne` or `block`
- `final-sale` instead of `fs` or `clearance`
- `high-risk` instead of `hr` or `risky`

**Plan your strategy:**
- Decide which products should never be editable and tag them when you create them
- Use Shopify Flow to automatically tag orders based on value, location, or customer type
- Document your tags so your team knows what each one does

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I added a tag but the order is still editable" icon="circle-question">
    **Check these things:**
    - Make sure the tag name in Revize matches exactly what you typed in Shopify
    - Click **Save** in Revize after adding the tag
    - Check if you added the tag to the right place (order page vs product page)
    - Refresh the customer's order page and try again
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Only one product is blocked but customers can still edit the order" icon="circle-check">
    **This is normal.** Product tags only block that specific product. Customers can still edit other items in the same order.
    
    If you want to block the entire order, use an order tag instead.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I block editing after a certain time?" icon="clock">
    **Yes, with Shopify Flow.** Set up a Flow that adds a `no-edit` tag to orders 2 hours after they're created. Then add `no-edit` to your order tag block list in Revize.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I need a restriction that's not available" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    **Email us!** Send your requirements to [hello@revize.app](mailto:hello@revize.app). We can set up custom rules for almost any scenario.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I automate tag blocking with Shopify Flow?" icon="robot">
 **Set up automatic tagging to block edits based on your business rules:**

 <Steps>
   <Step title="Add blocking tags to Revize">
     First, add your blocking tags in Revize under order tags or product tags (like `no-edit` or `high-risk`).
   </Step>
   <Step title="Create a Shopify Flow">
     In Shopify, create a Flow that adds these same tags to orders or products based on your conditions.
   </Step>
   <Step title="Edits get blocked automatically">
     When Flow adds the tag to an order or product, Revize automatically blocks editing.
   </Step>
 </Steps>

 **Example workflows:**
 - Add `no-edit` to your order tag block list → Create a Flow that tags orders with `no-edit` 2 hours after they're placed
 - Add `high-risk` to your order tag block list → Create a Flow that tags orders over $500 with `high-risk`
 - Add `final-sale` to your product tag block list → Create a Flow that tags clearance products with `final-sale`

 <Note>
   The tags you set up in Revize and the tags Flow adds to orders or products must match exactly for blocking to work.
