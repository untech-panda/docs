description: "Block editing for specific orders or products using Shopify tags. Control what customers can edit with simple tag-based rules."

<Note>
  Use Shopify tags to block edits on specific orders or products. Leave fields blank to allow edits on everything. Need advanced controls? Email [hello@revize.app](mailto:hello@revize.app) and we'll configure them for you.
</Note>

## Set it in the app

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Settings">
    In the Revize app, click **Settings** in the sidebar, then scroll to **Order edit restrictions**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add blocking tags">
    Enter tags you want to block under **Order tags** and **Product tags**, then click **Save**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tag in Shopify">
    Add these tags to orders or products in Shopify, either manually or with Shopify Flow. Revize reads them automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How blocking works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Order tag blocking" icon="tag">
    **What it does**
    
    If an order has any tag from your block list, customers cannot edit that entire order.

    **Common uses**
    - Block `high-risk` or `priority` orders from being edited
    - Keep `b2b` and `wholesale` orders locked
    - Prevent edits on `final-sale` or `clearance` orders

    **Example**
    
    You add `no-edit` to your order tag block list. Any order tagged with `no-edit` in Shopify becomes completely uneditable.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Product tag blocking" icon="box">
    **What it does**
    
    If a product in the order has any tag from your block list, customers cannot edit that specific line item. Other products in the order remain editable.

    **What gets blocked**
    - Changing quantity of that item
    - Swapping variants (size, color, etc.)
    - Removing that item from the order

    **Common uses**
    - Block edits on `final-sale` or `non-returnable` products
    - Protect `custom` or `personalized` items from changes
    - Lock `bundle` or `kit` components

    **Example**
    
    You add `final-sale` to your product tag block list. If an order contains a final-sale item, customers can edit other items but cannot change anything about the final-sale product.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced restrictions

For more complex rules, we can configure these for you:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Block cancellations only" icon="ban" color="#ef4444">
    Allow edits but prevent order cancellations using specific order tags.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hide address changes" icon="shield" color="#0ea5e9">
    Block address edits for specific customer segments using customer tags.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Curated add-products" icon="list" color="#22c55e">
    Show only specific products when customers try to add items to their order.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Line-item property blocks" icon="code" color="#8b5cf6">
    Block product edits based on custom line-item properties like bundle IDs or custom flags.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  **Automate with Shopify Flow:** Tag orders automatically based on your rules. For example, if your warehouse picks orders 60 minutes after creation, use Flow to add a blocking tag at the 58-minute mark.
</Tip>

## Best practices

**Keep tags simple and consistent:**
- Use clear names: `no-edit`, `final-sale`, `high-risk`
- Document your tagging strategy for your team
- Test with a sample order before going live

**Strategic tagging:**
- Tag products during product creation if they should never be editable
- Use Shopify Flow to tag orders based on conditions (value, location, customer type)
- Consider customer segments that might need restrictions

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Added a tag but order is still editable" icon="circle-question">
    **Check these steps:**
    - Verify the tag spelling matches exactly in both Revize and Shopify
    - Confirm you clicked **Save** in Revize after adding the tag
    - Refresh the order page and try again
    - Check if you added the tag to the right place (order vs product)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Product block working but other items still editable" icon="circle-check">
    **This is expected behavior.** Product blocks only affect specific line items. If an order has both blocked and unblocked products, customers can still edit the unblocked items.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Need a restriction that's not available" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    **We can help!** Email [hello@revize.app](mailto:hello@revize.app) with your specific requirements. We can set up custom rules using tags, line-item properties, customer segments, or other conditions.
