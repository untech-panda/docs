title: "Fulfillment sync"
description: "Control exactly when orders leave Revize and reach your 3PL or ERP. Align release timing with your edit window and fulfillment workflow."
---

<Note>
  Fulfillment sync works with your [Edit window](/setup/edit-window) and [Order processing](/setup/order-processing) settings. First set your edit window and choose hold or skip hold, then decide when orders are released to fulfillment.
</Note>

## What this controls

When Revize releases orders to your fulfillment system so your 3PL or ERP knows they're ready for picking and packing.

## Set it in the app

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Order Editing">
    In the Revize app, click **Order Editing** in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review your current settings">
    Confirm your edit window and whether you hold orders or skip hold.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose release timing">
    Select when orders should be released: when editing ends, at scheduled times, or using tags.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How it works with order processing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Hold orders + Release when editing ends" icon="pause">
    **Most common setup**
    
    Orders stay on hold while customers edit. When the edit window closes, Revize lifts the hold and your 3PL can pick the order.
    
    **Good for:** Most stores, especially those with fast fulfillment
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Hold orders + Scheduled release" icon="calendar">
    Orders stay on hold until your next scheduled release time (e.g., daily at 2 PM). Even if editing ends early, orders wait for the scheduled release.
    
    **Good for:** Batch fulfillment, warehouses that pick at specific times
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Skip hold + Tag-based release" icon="tag">
    Orders are processed normally without any holds but Revize adds a release tag when editing ends. Configure your 3PL to only pick tagged orders.
    
    **Good for:** Advanced 3PLs that can filter by tags, fast-moving operations
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tag configuration

<Note>
  **Default tag:** Revize uses `revize:order_released` but we can customize this for your 3PL's requirements. [Contact support](mailto:hello@revize.app) to change it.
</Note>

**Tags Revize adds:**
- `revize:order_released` - Added when editing window closes (if enabled)

**Tags Revize watches for:**
- Your stop tag (any tag you choose) — Have your WMS or Shopify Flow add a tag when picking starts (e.g., picked, wms:processing). Add the same tag under Order edit restrictions → Order tags in Revize, and the edit window will close immediately.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Orders not releasing to 3PL" icon="circle-exclamation">
    **Check:** 
    - Edit window has closed
    - Scheduled time has passed (if using scheduled release)
    - Release tag is being added (if using tag-based)
    - Your 3PL integration is filtering correctly
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="3PL picking orders too early" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Solution:** Use "Hold orders" or configure your 3PL to only pick orders with the release tag.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Want different tag names" icon="tag">
    **Solution:** [Contact support](mailto:hello@revize.app) - we can customize tag names for your workflow.
