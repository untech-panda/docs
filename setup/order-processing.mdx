## Your options

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Hold orders" icon="pause" color="#f59e0b">
    Orders are put on hold during the editing window, then released for fulfillment when editing closes.
    <br /><br /><em>Prevents your 3PL from picking orders too early.</em>
  </Card>

  <Card title="Skip hold" icon="play" color="#10b981">
    Orders flow normally through your systems. Use a release tag so your 3PL knows when editing is complete.
    <br /><br /><em>Good for tag-based fulfillment workflows.</em>
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How each option works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Hold orders (Recommended)" icon="pause">
    **How it works**
    
    Orders are automatically put on hold in Shopify when they're created. When the editing window closes, the hold is lifted and the order flows seamlessly into your fulfillment system.

    **Why it's recommended**
    - Prevents your 3PL from picking orders immediately after checkout
    - Ensures edited orders don't cause fulfillment conflicts
    - Simple workflow that works with any 3PL or WMS
    - No additional configuration needed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Skip hold" icon="play">
    **How it works**
    
    Orders flow normally through your systems without being put on hold. Revize can add a release tag when the editing window closes to signal your 3PL that the order is ready for fulfillment.

    **Pick this when**
    - Your 3PL can wait for a release tag before picking orders
    - You want to use tag-based workflows instead of hold/release

    **Release tag setup**
    
    Enable the **Add release tag** option to tag orders with `revize:order_released` when editing closes. Configure your 3PL to only pick orders that have this tag.

    <Note>
      Without a release tag, your 3PL might pick orders before customers finish editing, which can cause fulfillment issues.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Release tag configuration

When you select **Skip hold**, enable the release tag feature:

- **What it does**: Adds `revize:order_released` tag when editing window closes
- **Purpose**: Signals to your 3PL that the order is ready for fulfillment  
- **Benefit**: Prevents picking orders that are still being edited

**Setup steps**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable release tag">
    Turn on **Add release tag** in your Revize settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your 3PL">
    Set your 3PL to only pick orders with the `revize:order_released` tag
  </Step>
  <Step title="Orders flow safely">
    Orders flow normally but aren't picked until editing is complete
  </Step>
</Steps>
