## Details and examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Fixed time windows" icon="hourglass-half">
    **How it works**
    
    A countdown starts when the order is created. When it hits zero, editing closes automatically.

    **Pick it when**
    - You ship same-day or next-day
    - You want a quick buffer to catch typos and size mistakes

    **Common choices**
    - 15–30 minutes for very fast operations
    - 60–120 minutes for light batching
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Custom duration" icon="stopwatch">
    **How it works**
    
    You choose any window length (e.g., 2h, 24h, 48h). Editing closes once the timer ends.

    **Pick it when**
    - Your team starts pick/pack in defined waves later in the day
    - You want extra time for customers on preorders or made-to-order items

    **Tips**
    - Start conservative (e.g., 2–4 hours) and extend if support volume stays low
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Until fulfillment" icon="truck">
    **How it works**
    
    Editing remains open until the order status is set to **Fulfilled** in Shopify. Revize does not place the order on hold with this option.

    **Pick it when**
    - You want orders to flow normally through your systems
    - Your fulfillment process is fast and you can handle changes during picking
    - You prefer not to hold orders in a queue

    **Close editing when picking starts**
    
    Your WMS or Shopify Flow can add a tag (like `revize:stop-editing`) when an order is picked up for fulfillment. We'll configure Revize to watch for that tag and immediately close the editing window. [Contact Support](mailto:hello@revize.app) to set this up.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Scheduled cutoff (daily or weekly)" icon="calendar-days">
    **How it works**
    
    You set specific cutoff times (one or more per day, or a few days a week). At checkout, each order looks ahead to the next cutoff and stays editable until that moment. Think of it like a bus timetable—every order boards the next bus. When the bus leaves, editing closes and orders move into fulfillment.

    **Why teams love it**
    - Customers can fix mistakes while you're not packing
    - Pick lists are stable at the start of each run
    - No last-minute changes during pick and pack

    **Example schedule**
    - Tuesday 11:00 AM and Tuesday 6:00 PM
    - Thursday 11:00 AM and Thursday 6:00 PM

    **What customers experience**
    - Order placed *Thursday 6:15 PM* → editable until *Tuesday 11:00 AM*
    - Order placed *Tuesday 11:10 AM* → editable until *Tuesday 6:00 PM*
    - Order placed *Tuesday 6:05 PM* → editable until *Thursday 11:00 AM*

    <Note>
      Want a small **buffer** (e.g., lock 10–15 minutes before the cutoff so pick teams can stage carts)? [Contact Support](mailto:hello@revize.app) and we'll add it to your schedule.
    </Note>

## Which option should I choose?

- **Ship quickly**: 15–60 minutes or a short custom window  
- **Batch pick at set times**: scheduled cutoffs that mirror your pick runs  
- **Let your WMS decide**: until fulfillment, with an optional early lock via tag (we can configure this for you)
