### Scheduled Cutoff Times ‚≠ê New

<Info>
Set daily cutoff times when all editing windows close - perfect for batch processing orders.

**How it works:**
- Choose daily cutoff time (e.g., 1:00 AM)
- All orders remain editable until the next cutoff
- Example: Orders placed Thursday can be edited until Friday 1:00 AM
- Multiple cutoffs use the closest upcoming time

<Tip>
Ideal for stores with scheduled fulfillment runs or specific shipping deadlines.
