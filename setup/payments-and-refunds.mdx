## How price changes work

<Tip>
  When customers edit orders, prices can go up or down. Revize handles both automatically based on your settings.
</Tip>

**Price increases:** Revize shows a Pay now button and securely collects the difference through Shopify.  
**Price decreases:** Revize follows the refund option you choose below.

### Customer payment widgets

When order totals change, customers see clear widgets explaining the price difference and next steps:

    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", width: "100%", boxShadow: "0 4px 14px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)" }}
  />
  <small>Pay now widget appears when edits increase the order total.</small>



  <img

    alt="Refund widget when order total decreases"
    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", width: "100%", boxShadow: "0 4px 14px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)" }}
  />
  <small>Refund widget shows when edits reduce the order total.</small>


  <img
    src="/images/setup/confirm-now.png"
    alt="Confirm widget for same-price changes"
    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", width: "100%", boxShadow: "0 4px 14px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)" }}
  />
  <small>Confirm widget appears when changes don't affect the order total.</small>

## Your refund options

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="No refund" icon="ban" color="#e11d48">
    Customers can add items or swap to higher-value products. They cannot make changes that would reduce the total order value below the original amount.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Refund to original payment" icon="credit-card" color="#0ea5e9">
    If an edit lowers the total, Revize issues a partial refund back to the original payment method.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Refund as store credit" icon="gift" color="#10b981">
    If an edit lowers the total, Revize issues store credit for the difference so customers can use it on a future purchase.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## When to choose each option

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No refund" icon="ban">
    <strong>How it works</strong>  
    Keeps the final total at or above the original order amount. Even swaps are allowed; reducing value is blocked unless the shopper adds items or value to meet the original total.

    <strong>Choose this when</strong>
    - You want predictable revenue without partial refunds  
    - You want to offer broad editing flexibility without lowering totals  
    - You prefer fewer refund events in accounting

    <strong>Customer experience</strong>  
  If a change would lower the total, Revize blocks the edit and shows a message. The order total must stay at or above the original order amount.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Refund to original payment" icon="credit-card">
    <strong>How it works</strong>  
    When edits reduce the total, Revize automatically refunds the difference to the card or wallet used at checkout.

    <strong>Choose this when</strong>
    - You want a simple and familiar experience for shoppers  
    - You follow strict refund policies

    <strong>Customer experience</strong>  
    The Refund button shows the amount. After they confirm, the order updates and a partial refund is issued via Shopify.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Refund as store credit" icon="gift">
    <strong>How it works</strong>  
    Converts the difference into store credit rather than cash.

    <strong>Choose this when</strong>
    - You want to retain revenue and encourage repeat purchases  
    - You focus on lifetime value and loyalty

    <strong>Customer experience</strong>  
    The Refund button indicates credit will be issued. The order updates right away and the credit is available for next time.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Recommended settings

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="New stores" icon="seedling" color="#22c55e">
    <strong>Start with:</strong> Refund to original payment.  
    It's simple for customers and easy to support. You can switch to store credit later.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Established brands" icon="trophy" color="#f59e0b">
    <strong>Consider:</strong> Refund as store credit.  
    Keeps revenue in your ecosystem and often lifts future order value.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  You can change your refund policy anytime. The new setting applies to future edits. Orders already in progress keep the method that was active when they started editing.
