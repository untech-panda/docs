## Three customization areas

### Order Edit Message Box

  <img
    src="/images/setup/message-box-editor.png"
    alt="Order edit message box customization interface"
    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", width: "100%", boxShadow: "0 4px 14px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)" }}
  />
  <small>Customize the message box that appears on your thank you page to inform customers about order editing.</small>

**Appears on:** Thank you page after checkout  
**Purpose:** Inform customers they can edit their order

**Default text:**
- **Title:** "Good news! You can edit your orders"
- **Description:** "You have [duration] to make changes. You can add products, edit the shipping address, and much more."
- **Button:** "Edit order"

**Customize the appearance:** Go to **Settings > Checkout > Order status page** in your Shopify admin, find the Revize app block, and adjust styling options.

<Note>
  **Dynamic duration:** Use the `[duration]` variable to show exact time remaining, like "You have 30 minutes to make changes" - this creates urgency and improves conversion rates.
</Note>

**Creative alternatives for your message box:**
- "Oops, need to change something? No problem!"
- "Made a mistake? Fix it instantly!"
- "Your order isn't set in stone - edit it now!"

  <small>Set up notification banners that appear throughout the customer experience to remind about editing options.</small>

**Appears:** Throughout the customer journey as notification banners  
**Purpose:** Remind customers about editing availability

**Default text:**
- **Title:** (optional)
- **Description:** "Your order is available for editing!"

**Customize the appearance:** Go to **Settings > Checkout > Order status page** in your Shopify admin, find the Revize notification app block, and adjust styling.

<Tip>
  **Create urgency with duration:** Use descriptions like "You have [duration] left to edit your order!" to encourage immediate action. The variable automatically updates to show "30 minutes," "1 hour," etc.
</Tip>

**Engaging notification examples:**
- "Last chance to perfect your order!"
- "Still time to add that item you forgot!"
- "Quick! [duration] left to make changes!"
